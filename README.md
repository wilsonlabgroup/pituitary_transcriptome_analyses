# pituitary_transcriptome_analyses
The repo contains essential scripts and datasets to reproduce bioinformatics analyses in [Hou &amp; Chan et al. 2022](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.05.475069v1?rss=1) 

1. Scripts used to process and analyze mouse pituitary UTRseq data can be found in `UTRseq_analysis/` folder.
2. Scripts used to reprocess single-cell data from Cheung et al. 2018 can be found in `scRNAseq_analysis/` folder.
   * To run this script, download data from [GSE120410](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE120410) into `scRNAseq_analysis/input_files/`
3. Scripts used to run scMappR can be found in `scRNAseq_analysis/` folder.
   * Run single-cell reprocessing scripts (2.) prior to running this script
